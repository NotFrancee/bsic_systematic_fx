## About the Code

The code is grouped in the following directories: 

* `backtester`: code for the backtesting classes, which include the strategy as described by the paper, our improved version of the signal, and a signal which uses a rolling z-score instead of a simple Rolling MA
* `notebooks`: code for creating the plots for the article, and the notebook where we performed the factor analysis
* `utils`: code to load the data for currencies, swaps, cpi, and EM
* `other`: the code used to run the strategies using scripts and to run robustness checks
